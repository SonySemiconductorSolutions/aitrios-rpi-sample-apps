# Introduction üëã
Here we create sample applications using the tools we produce to help the commuity learn and explore how easy it is to build AI applications around the IMX500 sensor. Where we encourage you to build your own applications and the ideas you have. All Sample Applications are Python based examples built to use the Raspberry PI AI Camera, based on the IMX500 AI image sensor.

# Install üèóÔ∏è
Clone the repo and run applications in their directories. All applications are intended to be used in a uv environment and have a pyproject.toml file to install requirments. To install uv:

```
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
For more information on uv you can read their [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## Application Module Library 
Application Module Library is a Python library that simplifies the development of end-to-end appllications for the IMX500 vision sensor. With seamless integration of AITRIOS tools, it helps developers streamline their workflow and focus on what matters most. You can find [Application Module Library Github page](https://github.com/SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-rpi-application-module-library) where you find more documentation on how to build your own applications using the library.

If you wish to use a Yolo model you can get pretrained models and train your own with [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/sony-imx500/) and convert them for IMX500 and use in our Sample Applications or your own Applications.
